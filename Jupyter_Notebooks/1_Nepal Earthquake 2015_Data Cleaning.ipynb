Introduction\n","\n","As per statista.com, economic loss due to natural disaster events worldwide amounted to about 1.5 trillion US dollars in the last five years. It\n","becomes important for any individual or business to safeguard themselves from huge financial loss caused by an unforeseen event like fire, terrorism or any natural disasters like Earthquake, Flood, Windstorm, Tornado, Hail, Hurricane, or loss due to machinery breakdown in case of production plants. Providing protection against such financial loss by charging a nominal premium compared to property value is called Property Insurance. It is estimated that the global commercial insurance market is projected to reach from USD 692.33 Billion in 2020 to USD 1,227.8 Billion by 2028.\n","\n","From property insurer perspective, it is important to price the premiums effectively against each peril and for various occupancy types depending on their expected financial loss to be competitive in the market and be profitable at the same time. So, they employ Catastrophe Risk Modeling analyst to scrape the client’s property details, run the predictive model, asses the risk to identify the vulnerability and severity of property damage to generate the expected loss and charge accordingly for various catastrophe perils\n","\n","In real world, Catastrophe risk modeling combines historical disaster information with current demographics, building, and financial data to determine the potential financial impact of catastrophe in various geographic locations. However, the process of developing sophisticated catastrophe models is complex and draws on expertise from a broad range of technical and financial disciplines. Hence, we will limit ourselves to one peril Earthquake and just use one type of occupancy ‘residential’ in this case study for educational purpose and realize the power of machine learning in predictive analytics.\n","\n","We will preprocess and explore an historical earthquake event data and build a machine learning model to identify the severity of damage to buildings caused by an earthquake. Additionally, we will also merge household conditions data to capture the socio-economic and demographics of affected areas (learned from https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212094718301385) and see if they improve score in our classification task. This is useful for Property Insurers to assign different rates based on the expected severity of damage to client property that is identified by our machine learning model.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"gradient":{"editing":false,"id":"fb268316-146c-4e8d-8c1e-2ad15e773490","kernelId":""},"id":"kdVsU94c9t-8"},"source":["## 2.
